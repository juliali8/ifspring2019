			<li>I have experience with HTML/CSS/JS, however, I have never had the opportunity to implement, so I took this class in order to gain more skills and build more projects. Also, the way I learned HTML/CSS/JS is very much structured, so I wanted to delve more into the design aspect and be more creative.  </li>
			<li>Yes, I do have some experience with HTML/CSS/JS. I was a teaching assistant for a camp teaching web development and for the web development course here. Despite being a teaching assistant, my skills are very limited, because I never received any formal training.</li>
			<li>I want to be able to effectively and purposefully implement HTML/CSS/JS and showcase that through projects I create.</li>
			<li>Designing for the screen definitely means that it needs to be interactive, which is very limited on paper. With the power of technology, the screen can include many interactive components.</li>
			<li>I think <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix's</a> website design is very effective, because it is very simple to navigate. There are not a lot of words on the main page, allowing viewers to browse what they are most interested in - the shows and movies. They are also categorized into simple categories to allow for some organization.</li>
			<li>I think <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon's</a> website exemplifies effective communication. Considering how large of a platform Amazon is, it is still easy for customer's to navigate the website, which shows that Amazon communicate's it's functions well.</li>
			<li>I think <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB</a> has a website that works well. It is both simple design, but also has all the components to communicate information to the viewers. The mainpage starts with the most important thing people are looking for when visiting the site -- finding an AirBnB to rent. The design and communication makes it easy for users.</li>
