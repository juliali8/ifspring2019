        <h2>Feedback for Cindy</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
            <li>Because of your overall theme, I think it'd be fun if you used different fonts</li>
            <li>I think the font colors match the images well, and the postcards are overall very consistent</li>
            <li>The font size for the Coco mobile postcard feels a little small if read on a phone</li>
            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <li>I think adding more contrast would help, since there are color variations in your images, 
                sometimes the text and images blend together</li>
            <li>With the desktop view of Coco and both desktop and mobile views of Moana, 
                you could use a left to right gradient, since the areas where the quotes are located now 
                aren't the main components of the image</li>
            <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
            <li>The Coco and Moana mobile postcards both have quotes at the edge, 
                so I would think about varying browser widths, since if the width were smaller, the quotes would 
                end up on the main part of the postcard</li>
        </ul>
