FEEDBACK:
- add description of recipe to get an idea of what it is 
- reconsider adding something else instead of the strikethough in case the user wants to go back and read it
- toggle might not be necessary
- check the sizing of the title and images and consider changing the format

CONCERNS:
- implmenting the image carousal 
    - hoping to find something online that will help
- implmenting check boxes and strikethroughs
    - not really familiar with using it, but I feel like there's definitely stuff online
